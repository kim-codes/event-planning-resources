## Reaching your audience 

### Info to share 
It is important when reaching your audience to make sure you are sharing the important information they need. 
Below you will find a list of information I find useful to share upfront about an event. 
- Title 
- Date/time & location 
- What people should bring 
- Any pre-reqs (if it's a workshop - install *x* for example)
- Contact Info

### Where to share 
Another important key to reaching your audience is through the proper communication channels. Depending on your community, several items lsited below will be more effective than otheres.
- Facebook group 
- Facebook page
- Twitter 
- Slack 
- Posters 
- Newsletter 
- Classroom announcements 

#### Example Tweets
*Join [club name] on [date] for [purpose of event]  #[whatevercoolhashtag] at [place] ______(link to website / sign up )______.*

*In #[city-name]? Want to learn about [topic]? Join [club-name] at [place] on [date] ______(link to website/ sign up)______.* 

## Selecting a location 
Here are important factors to consider when choosing a location for your event.
- Easily accessible space 
- Near public transport / free parking
- Accommodation for any physical and/or learning disabilities 
- Restroom availability 
- Bonus: find a place that has good natural light → it’s recommended for learning 

### For Workshops/tech events
- Consistent access to power and free internet 
- Laptops/Computers for all participants 
  - is there a place on campus that can rent for those who do not have their own 
- Adequate number of outlets/powerstrips/adapters
